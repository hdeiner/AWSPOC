### Starting out with AWS RDS Oracle

##### Concept

> [The] Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Redwood Shores, California. The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software productsâ€”particularly its own brands of database management systems. In 2019, Oracle was the second-largest software company by revenue and market capitalization. The company also develops and builds tools for database development and systems of middle-tier software, enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, Human Capital Management (HCM) software, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and supply chain management (SCM) software.
>
>Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983, to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. At this stage Bob Miner served as the company's senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering.
> 
> In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company. Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems most of which support C.

>
> It's been a long time since 1977.  Today, Oracle revenue has risen to about $10B annually, with revenue of over $2B annually.  Larry Ellison has a personal net worth of almost $76B, according to Forbes.  Unhappily, the companay has not made many changes which keep up with the times, and has seduced it's users with wonderful features to stay relevant in a manner that is both closed and with a huge barrier to switch.  We are reaching the point where our company's future becomes an extension of Larry's largesse.  Should Larry decide that he would like to fund his hobby in souped up America's Cup high tech catamarans by trippling license fees, we would have no choice except to pay it.
>
> So, why is this experiment in here, you ask?  It should be a slam dunk to get HealthEngine working in the cloud with this.  It provides a baseline for performance against other implementations, and a baseline on the economics of moving away from Oracle at this time.  Furthermore, as far as risk mitigation goes, this should be a very safe move to get into the cloud.

#### Execution

### 01_startup.sh
This script uses simple Terraform and applies it.   
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

figlet -w 200 -f small "Startup Oracle AWS"
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
The terraform.aws_instance.tf is the most interesting of the terraform scripts because it does does all of the heavy lifting through provisiong.

The reason for doing the provisioning of the actual database, setting up the DDL using Liquibase, and loading sample data is that I don't want to install local clients (such as sqlplus) on the invoking machine.

The script that is run on the EC2 instance (provision.oracle.sh) does the provisioning of the database itself.  It is written to run in Oracle Linux 7.7, which was called out in the ami used for the EC2 instance.

This is what the console looks like when the script is executed.  It takes about 12 minutes.  But it is completely repeatable, and doesn't require any manual intervention.  It's the way our DBAs should create Oracle instances, regardless of the environment.  Everything is in Git, and anyone can use it.

### 02_populate.sh
This script was run on the AWS EC2 instance in the 01_startup.sh for this experiment to avoid having to install Oracle clients on our local machine.
<BR/>
### 03_shutdown.sh
This script is extremely simple.  It tells terraform to destroy all that it created.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

figlet -w 200 -f small "Shutdown Oracle AWS"
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
The console shows what it does.
